What is a compiler ?

A compiler is a software which converts a source code into machine understandable code.

There are various ways via which we can make a compiler and since the advent of C language compilers were being designed through this.

The compiler that I have made here is a simple one which incorporates the features of C++ , OOP and Semantic and Syntax Analysis.

This can be modified to perform various tasks , just by changing the code present in case 8.

This is very helpful for beginners who have basic and good knowledge of C / C++ and want to know the internal working of a compiler which were being ued initially.
